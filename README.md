# Retail Customer Retention Analytics – TARGET
## Project Overview
This project develops an interactive Customer Retention Analytics Dashboard in Power BI to analyze churn behavior, loyalty performance, store/channel effectiveness, and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). The solution consolidates customer demographics, transaction history, store data, and loyalty information to deliver actionable insights that improve retention, engagement, and regional strategy.

## Project Objective
Develop an interactive Customer Retention Analytics Dashboard in Power BI using Target’s customer data that will: 
* Consolidate customer demographics, purchase history, store/e-commerce performance, and loyalty data.
* Enable dynamic segmentation of high-value, repeat, and churned customers.
* Provide actionable insights to improve retention, loyalty engagement, and regional 
strategies.

## Dataset Description
* Customer_Demographics : Customer profile and membership details.
* Customer_Transactions : Purchase transaction records and promotion usage.
* Store_Locations : Store type, region, and opening year data.
* Loyalty_Program : Loyalty tier and points activity information.
* Churn_Labelled_Customers : Customer churn status, last purcahse data and churn reasons.

## Tools & Technology used: 
* Power BI Desktop
* Power Query for ETL & Data Transformation
* Data Modeling giving insights on the relationship between tables
* DAX - Measures & Calculated Columns
* Visualisations 

## Key Findings
### Churn & Retention Metrics
* Churn Rate : 24.50%
* Retention Rate : 75.50%
* Repeat customers can still churn, retention requires proactive engagement.

### Repeat Purchase Analysis
* Repeat Rate : 95.50%
* Average Purchase Frequency : 5.05
* Repeat purchases do not guarantee retention.

### Promotion & Loyalty Impact
* 39.30% of transactions applied promotions
* Promotions are underutilized, they are not significantly increasing average spend.
* Elite & Premium tiers show unexpectedly high churn.
* Points redemption rate is low

### Store & Channel Performance 
* Churn rate is higher in physical stores than the online store
* Average Transaction Amount of physical store is higher than online store
* The online store retain the customers but don't generate revenue as good as physical stores.
  
## Recommendations
* Implement tier-specific targeted promotions
* Improve points redemption visibility at checkout
* Introduce hybrid payment (cash + points)
* Strengthen engagement strategies for high-tier customers
  
## Conclusion 
This project delivers a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that transforms fragmented customer data into actionable retention insights. It enables data-driven decision-making to reduce churn, strengthen loyalty engagement, and improve long-term customer value.
